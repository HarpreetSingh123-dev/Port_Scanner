# Port_Scanner
A simple port scanner using javascript

This straightforward JavaScript port scanner leverages WebSocket connections to check whether a target system's ports are open. It accepts as arguments the originating port, the finishing port, and the target IP address. The scanner then repeatedly loops through the assortment of ports, attempting to connect to each one. A successful connection records that the port is open. It records that the port is closed or unreachable if there is a problem or the connection fails.
